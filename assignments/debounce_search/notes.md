    Deboucing

    When user stops pressing keys in input box, after that it waits for debounce delay time and then API call in made.

    So, we don't want to call API on each key pressed, but after some time when user stops entering keys in input box, so this way we reduced the number of API calls made.

    That help in improving performance of website.
